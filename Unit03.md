**Unit 3: Model Building with Multiple Regression** <span
id="3"></span> 
*This unit will provide you with a framework for building and evaluating
regression models. You will learn how to select regression models using
automatic procedures such as forward selection and backward elimination.
You will also learn to use diagnostic tools to evaluate the accuracy of
a regression model and to measure effects of multicollinearity*.

**Unit 3 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 20 hours to complete.

**Unit3 Learning Outcomes**  
Upon successful completion of this unit, the student will be able to:  
  
-   <span dir="LTR">perform selection of multiple regression models
    using forward selection, backward elimination, and stepwise
    selection procedures;</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">diagnose performance of a multiple
    regression;</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">explain and quantify multicollinearity; and</span>
-   <span dir="LTR">perform corrective actions to reduce the effects of
    multicollinearity.</span>
