**Unit 5: Nonparametric Statistics** <span id="5"></span> 
*Many methods in statistics assume that your population distribution is
normal. However, there are many scenarios in which this is not true. In
these cases, nonparametric statistics provide alternative statistical
methods because they do not involve population parameters. Upon
completion of this unit, you should be able to distinguish between
parametric and nonparametric test procedures and perform basic
nonparametric tests such as sign test and Wilcoxon signed-ranks test.
You also will learn to identify situations for which nonparmetric tests
are more appropriate.*

**Unit 5 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 20 hours to complete.
