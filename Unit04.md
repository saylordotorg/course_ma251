**Unit 4: Generalized Linear Model and Nonlinear Regression** <span
id="4"></span> 
*In this unit, you will be introducd to several new regression models,
including logistic regression, polynomial regression, and exponential
regression. These statistical models will provide you with a set of
toolboxes to analyze a wide range of problems. For instance, logistic
regression enables you to conduct regression analysis to predict outcome
of a binary dependent variable (e.g., “success” vs. “failure”). This
model is often used in medicine to predict risk of developing disease in
a predefined period. You also will learn about generalized linear
models, which were formulated as a way to unify various statistical
models, including linear regression and logistic regression.*

**Unit 4 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 25 hours to complete.
