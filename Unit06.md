**Unit 6: Introduction to Advanced Topics** <span id="6"></span> 
*This unit introduces you to a wide range of techniques used in modern
statistics to address the rapidly increasing need for analyzing
large-scale data and making predictions. Advances in information
technology have led to explosion in data in all aspects of our life.
Consequently, statistics and predictive analytics have become a major
driving force for scientific discoveries, technological advances, and
improvements in quality of life in the twenty-first century. You will
learn about survival analysis, time series analysis, principal component
analysis, structural equation models, and support vector machine. While
each of the topics discussed in this unit deserves a separate course,
the objective of this unit is to get you acquainted with these topics
and provide you with some basic guidance so you can study these topics
with more depth in the future.*

**Unit 6 Time Advisory**  
This unit will take you approximately 68 hours to complete.
